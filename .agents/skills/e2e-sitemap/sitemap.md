# agent.branch — bot-friendly sitemap & E2E walk spec

Machine-followable map of the whole app surface. Read the protocol in
`SKILL.md` first (status-line sync, dialog policy, offline expectations).
Base URL: `http://localhost:3000`. All copy strings below are exact and were
validated against the running app; `walk-runner.mjs` in this folder is the
executable form of this spec (run `node .agents/skills/e2e-sitemap/walk-runner.mjs`
from the repo root against a fresh dev server).

## 1. Node inventory

### Pages

| Node | Path | Render | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Workspace | `/` | server → client workspace | The whole product surface; everything below hangs off it |
| Public skill profile | `/skills/[owner]/[name]` | server, force-dynamic | 404 for missing/private slugs; badge or `potentially unsafe — not validated` label when a publication exists |

### Workspace navigation (side rail)

Match nav buttons by **accessible name** — `getByRole("button", { name: … })`.
The rail is a collapsed icon rail (name = `aria-label`) that expands on hover
into a labelled slideout (name = visible text, `aria-label` gone), so a CSS
`[aria-label=…]` selector breaks mid-run; the role query works in both states.

| Nav node | Accessible name | Interaction-panel mode it opens |
|---|---|---|
| Build | `Build` | `Describe your skill` — chat drives the build loop |
| Import | `Import` | `Import a skill` — paste `SKILL.md` or a public GitHub URL |
| My skills | `My skills` | saved-skill list with `Open` cards |
| Equipment | `Equipment` | paste a response schema / tool contract, or chat-author one |
| History | `History` | revision + run entries, restore cards |
| Templates | `Templates` | reviewed Skill-library entries + search |
| Models | `Models` | model console overlay (admin-gated when auth is on) |

### Hero surface (always mounted on `/`)

| Node | Selector | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| View toggle | buttons `Rendered` / `Source` | two renderers of the same skill; Rendered is default |
| Quality chip | `button[aria-label^="Quality"]` | pure lint — works offline, zero tokens |
| Metadata chip | button `Metadata` | editable name, description, category + tags; local → gateway → deterministic ladder |
| Visualise chip | button `Visualise` | skill IR → Mermaid; deterministic fallback offline |
| Run chip | button `Run` | test run (evaluation — needs a model) |
| Triggers chip | button `Triggers` | triggering eval (evaluation — needs a model) |
| Safety chip | button `Safety` | safety rating (evaluation — needs a model) |
| Export chip | button `Export` | standard skill folder manifest; works offline |
| Draft controls | buttons `Start a draft` / `Set as main version` / `Discard draft` | banner `Editing a draft` vs `Viewing the main version` |
| Publish | button `Publish` (main version only) | opens `Publish skill` form for the public `owner/name` address; submit reaches `/api/publications` |
| Status line | `[role="status"]` | the synchronisation point for every step |

### Confirm dialogs (native `confirm()`)

| Trigger | Message starts with | Offline policy |
|---|---|---|
| Set as main version | `Set this draft as your main version?` | accept |
| — follow-up offer | `Optional: run a safety rating on this draft first?` | **dismiss** — accepting runs a model-costing safety rating; offline it fails and aborts the promote |
| — non-passing verdict | `The safety rating is …` | accept to promote anyway |
| Discard draft | `Discard this draft?` | accept |
| Restore (History) | restore confirmation | accept |

### API surface

Skill-carrying POSTs take a structured source, not raw `SKILL.md` text:
`{ "skill": { "frontmatter": { "name", "description" }, "body" } }`.
Equipment quality routes take `{ "document": "<JSON string>", "surface": "insights" | "breakdown" }`.

| Route | Method | Auth | Offline (no model / memory adapters) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/api/build` | POST (SSE) | signed-in | stream opens; model error surfaces as streamed error event |
| `/api/import` | POST | signed-in | works (GitHub URL fetch needs a token; paste always works) |
| `/api/lint` | POST | signed-in | works — pure analysis |
| `/api/visualise` | POST | signed-in | works — deterministic fallback |
| `/api/export` | POST | signed-in | works — pure analysis |
| `/api/metadata-suggest` | POST | signed-in | works — keyword fallback |
| `/api/test-run` | POST (SSE/JSON) | signed-in | **503** `model_unavailable` before any stream opens |
| `/api/triggering-eval` | POST (SSE/JSON) | signed-in | **503** `model_unavailable` |
| `/api/safety-review` | GET, POST | signed-in | GET works (rating lookup); POST **503** offline |
| `/api/response-schema` | POST | signed-in | works — pure quality check |
| `/api/response-schema/build` | POST (SSE) | signed-in | stream opens; provider-key error streamed |
| `/api/tool-contract` | POST | signed-in | works — pure quality check |
| `/api/tool-contract/build` | POST (SSE) | signed-in | stream opens; provider-key error streamed |
| `/api/skills` · `/api/skills/[id]` · `…/restore` · `…/runs` · `…/branches[...]` | GET/POST/DELETE | signed-in | work against memory adapters (state resets on restart) |
| `/api/skill-library` (`?surface=templates`, `?q=`, `?category=`, `?tag=`, `?slug=`) | GET | public read | works — pure read over publications |
| `/api/publications` | POST | signed-in | works offline (memory) — publishes the user's main version |
| `/api/tap-repository` | GET | public read | works — pure file-set render |
| `/api/model-router` | GET, POST | admin (open when auth off) | works — secret-free snapshot / selection |
| `/api/admin/harness-report` | GET | admin | works — static correlation |
| `/api/admin/benchmark` | GET, POST | admin | GET works; POST **503** offline |
| `/api/cron/retention` | GET | `Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET` | **401 — locked** (fail-safe) when secret unset |

## 2. Walk paths

Run in order for a full pass. `precondition: WALK-01` means the walk needs the
imported skill from this server session (memory resets on restart — and the
free tier caps skills at five, so repeated import runs against one server
session eventually hit `You're at your skill limit - delete a skill to make
room, or upgrade for more.`; **restart the dev server for a clean session**).

Fixture used by WALK-01 (paste as-is):

```markdown
---
name: inbox-triage
description: Sort unread email into respond, archive, and escalate piles.
---

# Inbox triage

## Workflow
1. Fetch unread email.
2. Classify each message as respond, archive, or escalate.
3. Summarise the respond pile.
```

### WALK-01 · Import (seeds session state)

| # | action | selector | expect (`[role="status"]` unless noted) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | goto `/` | — | page 200; hero renders a skill document |
| 2 | click | nav button `Import` | panel title `Import a skill` |
| 3 | fill fixture, click | `textarea`, then button `Import skill` | `Importing…` → `Import complete.` |
| 4 | assert | hero heading | title reflects `inbox-triage` |

### WALK-02 · Hero views

precondition: WALK-01

| # | action | selector | expect |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | click | button `Source` | monospace raw `SKILL.md` incl. frontmatter text |
| 2 | click | button `Rendered` | friendly document view returns |

### WALK-03 · Quality (lint)

precondition: WALK-01 · offline-safe

| # | action | selector | expect |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | click | `button[aria-label^="Quality"]` | `Quality running…` → `Quality ready.` |

### WALK-04 · Visualise

precondition: WALK-01 · offline-safe (deterministic fallback)

| # | action | selector | expect |
|---|---|---|---|

### WALK-04B · Metadata suggestion

precondition: WALK-01 · offline-safe (route's deterministic fallback)

| # | action | selector | expect |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | click | button `Metadata` | `Metadata running…` → `Metadata ready.` |
| 2 | assert | capability panel | same editable name, description, category, tags + rationale shape on every rung; offline copy is `Metadata suggestion` |
| 3 | click | button `Apply suggestion` | `Suggestion applied.`; hero returns to the author-owned document |

### WALK-05 · Export

precondition: WALK-01 · offline-safe

| # | action | selector | expect |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | click | button `Export` | `Export running…` → `Export ready.` |
| 2 | assert | capability panel | standard skill folder manifest (`inbox-triage/SKILL.md`) listed |

### WALK-06 · My skills → open

precondition: WALK-01

| # | action | selector | expect |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | click | nav button `My skills` | `Loading skills…` → panel lists `inbox-triage` |
| 2 | click | `Open` on the entry card | `Opening skill…` → `Skill opened.` |
| 3 | assert | draft controls | `Viewing the main version` + button `Start a draft` |
| 4 | assert | publish control | button `Publish` is available for the main version |

### WALK-07 · Draft lifecycle (start → promote, start → discard)

precondition: WALK-06 · dialog policy from §1 required

| # | action | selector | expect |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | click | button `Start a draft` | `Starting a draft…` → `Draft started. Your main version is unchanged.` |
| 2 | assert | draft banner | `Editing a draft` |
| 3 | click (accept promote confirm, **dismiss** safety-rating offer) | button `Set as main version` | `Setting as main version…` → `This draft is now your main version.` |
| 4 | click | button `Start a draft` | `Draft started. Your main version is unchanged.` |
| 5 | click (accept confirm) | button `Discard draft` | `Discarding draft…` → `Draft discarded. Back to your main version.` |
| 6 | assert | draft controls | back to `Viewing the main version` |

### WALK-08 · Offline evaluation probes (only when no model key is configured)

precondition: WALK-01 · asserts the graceful degradation, one chip at a time

| # | action | selector | expect |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | click | button `Run` | error status `No model is configured.`; chip re-enables |
| 2 | click | button `Triggers` | `No model is configured.`; chip re-enables |
| 3 | click | button `Safety` | `No model is configured.`; chip re-enables |

With a model key configured, replace with: `Run` → `Test run ready.`,
`Triggers` → `Triggering eval ready.`, `Safety` → `Safety rating ready.` —
these spend tokens.

### WALK-09 · History

precondition: WALK-07 (needs revisions to list) · dialog policy required for restore

| # | action | selector | expect |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | click | nav button `History` | `Loading history…` → `History loaded.` |
| 2 | assert | panel | revision entries (and run entries when evals have run) |
| 3 | (optional) click restore on an older revision (accept confirm) | restore card | `Restoring…` → `Version restored.` |

### WALK-10 · Equipment

independent · offline-safe for the paste path

| # | action | selector | expect |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | click | nav button `Equipment` | panel title `Equipment` |
| 2 | fill plain language (e.g. `a schema for invoice summaries`), click | `textarea`, then button `Send` | routes to the chat authoring loop; **offline** it fails with `No API key for "<provider>". Add one in the model console or .env.local.` |
| 3 | fill a JSON Schema (`{"title":"Invoice summary","type":"object",…}`), click | `textarea`, then button `Send` | `Checking response schema…` → `Response schema "Invoice summary" checked and kept for tool contracts to reference.` |
| 4 | fill a tool contract (`{"name":"fetch_unread_email","description":…,"input":…,"output":…}`), click | `textarea`, then button `Send` | `Checking tool contract…` → `Tool contract "fetch_unread_email" checked — it runs with your next test run.` |

Routing rule: JSON object with string `name` + `description` → tool contract;
other JSON object → response schema (named by `title`); anything that isn't a
JSON object → a chat turn for the authoring loop. Checked contracts bundle
into the next test run automatically.

### WALK-11 · Templates / Skill library

independent · offline-safe (pure read; empty when no publications exist)

| # | action | selector | expect |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | click | nav button `Templates` | `Loading Templates…` → `No Templates yet.` (empty) or `Templates loaded.` |
| 2 | fill `inbox`, click | `textarea`, then button `Search` | `Searching…` → `No matching Templates.` (empty) or `Templates search loaded.` |
| 3 | (with publications) search an `owner/name` slug | same | `Skill library entry loaded.` |

### WALK-12 · Model console

independent · open when auth is off (dev); admin-gated when auth is on

| # | action | selector | expect |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | click | nav button `Models` | console overlay opens with provider/model selection |
| 2 | assert | overlay | secret-free snapshot — no key material anywhere in the DOM |

### WALK-13 · Public profile page

independent

| # | action | selector | expect |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | goto `/skills/nobody/does-not-exist` | — | 404 |
| 2 | (with a publication) goto its `/skills/<owner>/<name>` | — | 200; rendered skill + trust tier + safety badge or `potentially unsafe — not validated` label |

### WALK-14 · API probes (curl-level, no browser)

independent · request shapes in §1

| # | probe | expect |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `POST /api/lint` with a structured skill source | 200 JSON insights |
| 2 | `POST /api/test-run` offline | 503, `model_unavailable` |
| 3 | `GET /api/skill-library?surface=templates` | 200 JSON feed |
| 4 | `GET /api/tap-repository` | 200 file set (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` + `skills/**`) |
| 5 | `GET /api/cron/retention` without bearer secret | 401 — locked |
| 6 | `GET /api/model-router` (auth off) | 200 snapshot with no key material in the body |
